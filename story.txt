It was a dark and stormy night. I was walking home by myself when all of a sudden I heard a scurrying in the woods. I turned around to see a dark figure a few feet behind me. I started to run as fast as I could because I didn't know if it was a person or a creature. When I finally saw him in the light I was terrfied. He was 6ft tall with green skin and ragged clothes. He growled as I ran even faster.
