It was a dark and stormy night.
 I was walking home by myself when all of a sudden I heard a scurrying in the woods. 
I turned around to see a dark figure a few feet behind me. 
I started to run as fast as I could because I didn't know if it was a person or a creature. 
When I finally saw him in the light I was terrfied. 
He was 6ft tall with green skin and ragged clothes. 
He growled as I ran even faster. 
I ran into a cave in the hope that he was too large to fit in. 
I crawled through the cave and took the time to look behind me, and to my 
horror, I saw the creature crawling behind me at a rate slightly faster than me 
I scrambled and started to run faster but as it got closer, all I could do was 
kick at it. 
Once I started kicking it, it recoiled back. 
This gave me the chance to run into the cave and lose the creature in the twists and turns. 
It was terrifying, sitting in the damp, dark cave floor with my head in my hand 
and hearing the creature's growls and roars. Eventually, even they faded away. 
He was gone. Still, I waited for hours upon hours before I got the courage to 
venture out. It was day, the birds chirped and animals called.
There was no sign of my terrifying pursuer, no signs but the scratches and dirt covering my body.
